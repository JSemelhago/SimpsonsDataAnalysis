# SimpsonsDataAnalysis

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a preliminary use of Python analysis tools including but not limited to `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly` and includes the use of data science principles such as vectorization and split-apply-combine.

All of this is applied to a group of Simpsons datasets found in a [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset)  

## Code

### Prerequisites

Multiple packages are needed to successfully run the scripts, refer to the script headers to ensure that these packages have been installed. All can be installed using `pip3` or `conda` from the `pypi` or `conda-forge` channels respectively.


### Running It

Running the code requires following these steps:

1. Clone this repository in your local directory
2. Navigate to the `scripts` directory and either run `SimpsonsAnalysis.ipynb` using `jupyter nbconvert` and the `--execute` flag or run `SimpsonsAnalysis.py` using `python3`
3. Output figures will be generated in the `output` directory
